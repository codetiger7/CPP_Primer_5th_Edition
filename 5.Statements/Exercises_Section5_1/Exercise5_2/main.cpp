// Exercise 5.2
// What is a block?
// When might you use a block?


// What is a block?
// a block is the same a s a compound statement
// a block is a series of zero or more statements collected into a compount statement
// a compound statements beginning and end are defined by curly braces
// example:
// {
//    int a = 0;
//    int b = 4;
//    int sum = a + b;
// }

// When might you use a block
// It is used when you need several statements to be seen as a single statements
// Example: an if evaluation only accepts a single statement attachment to its body
// But by adding curly braces (a compound statement), you can add as many simple statements
// as you want inside the compound statement, and all of these will be seen by the if as
// a single statement.
