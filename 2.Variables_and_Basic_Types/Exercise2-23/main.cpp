// Exercise 2.23
// Given a pointer p
// can you determine if p points to a valid object?
// if so how? if not why?

//  No you cannot know just by beeing given a pointer
// if pointer is set to nullptr, you can check for that
// if not you do not know if the pointer is valid, since you don't know
// if address it has is valid.
