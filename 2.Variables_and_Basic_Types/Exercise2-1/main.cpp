// Exercise 2.1
// 1. What are the differences between
// int, long, long long, and short?

// 2. Between unsigned and signed type?

// 3. Between a float and a double?


// 1. Int is at least 16 bits, while float is at least 32 bits
// long long is at least 64 bits
// short is at least 16 bits

// 2. unsigned can only represent zero and positive numbers
// signed can represent both positive and negative numbers

// 3. float is a single-precision floating point with minimum 6 significant digits
// double is a double-precision floating point with minimum 10 significant digitst
